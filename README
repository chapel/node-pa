This is just an experiment to get real audio working with Node.js 

I have included an install script that should for all intents and purposes download and compile PortAudio and sndfile. Then it will build the module so that you can use it. 

At this point, it is extremely buggy, and doesn't really work as well as it should. I implore that if anyone can, please fork and submit a patch. If need be I would be willing to add contributors if there was interest.

I will still try to get this working fully, but at this point in time, I really don't have the knowledge of C++ to do so.
